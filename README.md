# Abstract

This document describes the methods and techniques I use to learn Mandarin Chinese.

I start off with Pinyin (romanization of Chinese syllables), then the core methods to learn from any textbook, article, and Chinese reader.

# Pinyin

## Yoyo Chinese Pinyin Course

The best training I’ve found anywhere is Yangyang Cheng’s “Yoyo Chinese Pinyin Course: Learn to Pronounce Mandarin Chinese” on YouTube.

It’s a 27 lesson course that takes you from knowing nothing about tones and syllable pronunciation to full on mastery.  The total run time is 2h32m.  There’s a lot packed in this course, and I recommend going through it fairly quickly the first time around, and then revisit specific lessons every month or so to firm up those weak spots until you’re very comfortable with it.

Once you’ve gone through this material, you can skip any intro Pinyin material in textbooks.

# Tools

## Pleco Chinese Dictionary [iOS]

This is the number one resources I use on a daily basis.  Aside from being an insanely awesome dictionary (with pinyin, Chinese character via keyboard, handwriting, and voice, as well as English lookups), it has a stroke animation option for every character to help you learn exactly how to write a character.  It’s awesome.


I also really enjoy the voices used for pronouncing words and example sentences.  So handy to hear words spoken in context.  Another cool feature I use every now and then is the OCR (optical character recognition) where you can hold your phone over arbitrary Chinese characters, and it will pick out the characters and allow you to look them up.  It also has some really cool flashcard features too.

The in-app purchases can add up, but are worth every penny spent.  I love it!

## Printable Mi Zi Ge Pages

The Mi Zi Ge grid is awesome for full page writing.  Very clean.

The “sheet5.doc” has lines above the Mi Zi Ge frames for you to write pinyin and/or English.  Very handy.

## Integrated Chinese 4th Edition Level 1
- Textbook (SC): https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1622911350
- Workbook (SC): https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1622911369
- Character Workbook (SC and TC): https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1622911377

Note: SC means Simplified Chinese Characters, TC means Traditional Chinese Characters

Integrated Chinese (IC4E1) textbooks are used in schools and colleges everywhere.  It is hands down the most consistent series I’ve found (in method, font and multimedia usage).  A companion website is due out soon that allows for interactive learning too.

Each chapter is broken up two dialog and vocabulary sections.  I recommend going through the materials in this order:

Character workbook for the dialog section.  Go through writing each characters eight to ten times just to familiarize yourself with each character, its components, pinyin, and definition, and get the feel for it.  This helps you recognize it in the dialog and vocabulary.

Next, go through the textbook dialog section.  Write everything down in a notebook and say it out loud (checking pronunciation with the audio files you download from the website, and/or in Pleco).  This hand-eye muscle memory greatly increases your character retention.

Finally, go through the workbook dialog section.  This will cement your understanding of the vocabulary and grammar points for the section.

## Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar, 2nd Edition

- Textbook: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0415827140
- Workbook: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0415834880

Modern Mandaring Chinese Grammar (MMCG2E) is the most comprehensive grammar resources I’ve found.  It has the best Pinyin tone rules section I’ve found, as well as the material divided into two sections: Part A: Structures, and part B: Situations and functions.  This way, you can go directly to the section you’re looking for, or go through it page by page.  Excellent resource.

A word of caution.  If you’re a beginner and going through it page by page, you are likely to run into exercises that assume you have a higher level 

## Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary (English and Mandarin Chinese Edition)
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0966075005

This reference is great at helping understand the composition and meanings of characters.  I use it to look up new characters and to see if there are any additional meanings that aren't in the Pleco app.
